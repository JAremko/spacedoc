#+TITLE: Nim layer

[[file:img/logo.png]]

* Description
This layer adds support for the multi-paradigm language =Nim=.

** Features:

- tag :: Code completion.
- Jump to definition.
- Syntax checking.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to

** Lord of the Rings
My favorite scenes are (in this order)

1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
  + this was already my favorite scene in the book
  + I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
  - on DVD only
  He makes a really funny face when it happens.

But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film are:

- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
  him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

add =nim= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
For syntax checking, the =syntax-checking= layer must also be added.
For all the features to work properly, =nimsuggest= must be installed properly

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "this is some code"
#+END_SRC

and =nimsuggest= binary must be in $PATH.
